## Random Numbers

Generating good quality random numbers is crucial for any Monte Carlo code. In addition to generating pseudo random numbers with good statistics and in minimal CPU time, we also have the requirement that computations should be reproducible and the random number sequences independent on each worker when the code runs in parallel mode.

We define the random number generator in the module `ConsistentRNG.jl`. The rng can be seeded with [`seedCRNG!`](@ref). Reproducible and independent seeds for each thread are generated by a hashing transformation.

For the random number generator we are currently using
'Xoroshiro256Plus' from 'RandomNumbers.jl'. For benchmarks and statistical test results see the
[Documentation of `RandomNumbers.jl`](https://sunoru.github.io/RandomNumbers.jl/stable/man/benchmark/#Benchmark-1).
