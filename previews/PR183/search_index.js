For calculating observables, we use AllOverlaps for the ReplicaStrategy.

PDVecs perform mapreduce, foreach, and various linear algebra operations in a threaded manner. If MPI is available, these operations are automatically distributed as well. As such it is not recommended to iterate over pairs, keys, or values directly unless explicitly performing them on the localpart of the vector.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nstyle =default_style(V): A StochasticStyle that is used to select the spawning strategy in the FCIQMC algorithm.\ninitiator =NonInitiator(): An InitiatorRule, used in FCIQMC to remove the sign problem.\ncommunicator: A Communicator that controls how operations are performed when using MPI. The defaults are NotDistributed when not using MPI and PointToPoint when using MPI.\n\nExtended Help\n\nSegmentation\n\nThe vector is split into Threads.nthreads() subdictionaries called segments. Which dictionary a key-value pair is mapped to is determined by the hash of the key. The purpose of this segmentation is to allow parallel processing - functions such as mapreduce, add! or dot (full list below) process each subdictionary on a separate thread.\n\nFor parallel binary operations, the numbers of segments in both vectors must match. To ensure this, it is best to leave the number of segments at its default value.\n\nExample\n\njulia> add = FermiFS2C((1,1,0,0), (0,0,1,1));\n\njulia> op = HubbardMom1D(add; t=4/π^2, u=4);\n\njulia> pv = PDVec(add => 1.0)\n1-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n  fs\"|↑↑↓↓⟩\" => 1.0\n\njulia> pv = op * pv\n7-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n  fs\"|↑↓↑↓⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↑↑↓↓⟩\" => 4.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↓↑⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↑↓⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|⇅⋅⋅⇅⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↑↓↓↑⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|⋅⇅⇅⋅⟩\" => 1.0\n\njulia> map!(x -> -x, values(pv)); pv\n7-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n  fs\"|↑↓↑↓⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|↑↑↓↓⟩\" => -4.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↓↑⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↑↓⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|⇅⋅⋅⇅⟩\" => -1.0\n  fs\"|↑↓↓↑⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|⋅⇅⇅⋅⟩\" => -1.0\n\njulia> dest = similar(pv)\n0-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n\njulia> map!(x -> x + 2, dest, values(pv))\n7-element PDVec: style = IsDeterministic{Float64}()\n  fs\"|↑↓↑↓⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↑↑↓↓⟩\" => -2.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↓↑⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↓↑↑↓⟩\" => 3.0\n  fs\"|⇅⋅⋅⇅⟩\" => 1.0\n  fs\"|↑↓↓↑⟩\" => 3.0\n  fs\"|⋅⇅⇅⋅⟩\" => 1.0\n\njulia> sum(values(pv))\n-6.0\n\njulia> dot(dest, pv)\n10.0\n\njulia> dot(dest, op, pv)\n44.0\n\nMPI\n\nWhen MPI is active, all parallel reductions are automatically reduced across MPI ranks with a call to MPI.Allreduce.\n\nIn a distributed setting, PDVec does not support iteration without first making it explicit the iteration is only to be performed on the local segments of the vector. This is done with localpart. In general, even when not using MPI, it is best practice to use localpart when explicit iteration is required.\n\nUse with KrylovKit\n\nPDVec is compatible with eigsolve from KrylovKit.jl. When used, the diagonalisation is performed in a threaded and distributed manner. Using multiple MPI ranks with this method does not distribute the memory load effectively, but does result in significant speedups.\n\nExample\n\njulia> using KrylovKit\n\njulia> add = BoseFS((0,0,5,0,0));\n\njulia> op = HubbardMom1D(add; u=6.0);\n\njulia> pv = PDVec(add => 1.0);\n\njulia> results = eigsolve(op, pv, 4, :SR);\n\njulia> results[1][1:4]\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n -3.4311156892322234\n  1.1821748602612363\n  3.7377753753082823\n  6.996390417443125\n\nParallel functionality\n\nThe following functions are threaded MPI-compatible:\n\nFrom Base: mapreduce and derivatives (sum, prod, reduce...), all, any,map!
