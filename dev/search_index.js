It has a StochasticStyle that is used to select an appropriate spawning strategy in the FCIQMC algorithm.\n\nSee also: AbstractDVec.\n\nConstructors\n\nDVec(dict::AbstractDict[; style, capacity]): create a DVec with dict for storage. Note that the data may or may not be copied.\nDVec(args...[; style, capacity]): args... are passed to the Dict constructor. The Dict is used for storage.\nDVec{K,V}([; style, capacity]): create an empty DVec{K,V}.\nDVec(dv::AbstractDVec[; style, capacity]): create a DVec with the same contents as  adv. The style is inherited from dv by default.\n\nThe default style is selected based on the DVec's valtype (see default_style). If a style is given and the valtype does not match the style's eltype, the values are converted to an appropriate type.\n\nThe capacity argument is optional and sets the initial size of the DVec via sizehint!.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> dv = DVec(:a => 1)\nDVec{Symbol,Int64} with 1 entries, style = IsStochasticInteger{Int64}()\n  :a => 1\n\njulia> dv = DVec(:a => 2, :b => 3; style=IsDynamicSemistochastic())\nDVec{Symbol,Float32} with 2 entries, style = IsDynamicSemistochastic{Float64, true}(1.0, Inf, 1.0)\n  :a => 2.0\n  :b => 3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"API.html#Rimu.DictVectors.Initiator","page":"API","title":"Rimu.DictVectors.Initiator","text":"Initiator(threshold) <: InitiatorRule\n\nInitiator rule to be passed to InitiatorDVec.
