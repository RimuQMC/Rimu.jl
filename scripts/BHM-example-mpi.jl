# # Example 2: Rimu with MPI

# In this example, we will demonstrate using Rimu with MPI. 

# A runnable script for this example is located 
# [here](https://github.com/joachimbrand/Rimu.jl/blob/develop/scripts/BHM-example-mpi.jl).
# Run it with `mpirun julia BHM-example-mpi.jl`.

# We start by importing `Rimu` and `Rimu.RMPI`, which contains MPI-related
# functionality.
using Rimu
using Rimu.RMPI

# We will compute the ground-state of a Bose-Hubbard model in momentum space with 10 particles
# in 10 sites.

# First, we define the Hamiltonian. We want to start from an address with zero momentum.

address = BoseFS((0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))

# We will set the interaction strength `u` to `6`. The hopping strength `t` defaults to `1.0`.

hamiltonian = HubbardMom1D(address; u=6.0)

# Next, we construct the starting vector. Wrap a vector in `MPIData` to make it MPI
# distributed. We set the vector's style to [`IsDynamicSemistochastic`](@ref), which
# improves statistics and reduces the sign problem.

dvec = MPIData(DVec(address => 1.0; style=IsDynamicSemistochastic()))

# We set a reporting strategy. We will use [`ReportToFile`](@ref), which writes the reports
# directly to a file. This is useful for reducing memory use in long-running jobs, as we
# don't need to keep the results in memory. Setting `save_if=is_mpi_root()` will ensure only
# the root MPI rank will write to the file. The `chunk_size` parameter determines how often
# the data is saved to the file. Progress messages are suppressed with `io=devnull`.

r_strat = ReportToFile(filename="result.arrow", save_if=is_mpi_root(), reporting_interval = 1, chunk_size=1000, io=devnull)

# Now, we can set other parameters as usual. We will perform the computation with 5_000
# walkers. We will also compute the projected energy.

s_strat = DoubleLogUpdate(targetwalkers=5_000)
post_step = ProjectedEnergy(hamiltonian, dvec)

 # The `@mpi_root` macro performs an action on the root rank only, which is useful for printing.
 
@mpi_root println("Running FCIQMC with ", mpi_size(), " rank(s).")

# Finally, we can run the computation.

lomc!(hamiltonian, dvec; r_strat, s_strat, post_step, dÏ„=1e-4, laststep=5_000);
