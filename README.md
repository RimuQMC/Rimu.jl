*Random Integrators for many-body quantum systems*

The grand aim is to develop a toolbox for many-body quantum systems that can be
represented by a Hamiltonian in second quantisation language. Currently there
are tools to find the ground state with FCIQMC or with a Lanczos algorithm
(using KrylovKit for small Hilbert spaces). Later, we may add tools to solve the
time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation and Master equations for open system
time evolution.

**Concept:** Joachim Brand and Elke Pahl.

**Contributors:** Joachim Brand, Elke Pahl, Mingrui Yang, Matija Cufar.

### Install `Rimu`

`Rimu` can be installed with the package manager directly from the github
repository. Either hit the `]` key at the Julia REPL to get into `Pkg` mode and
type
```julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/joachimbrand/Rimu.jl#master
```
where `master` can be exchanged with the name of the desired git branch.
Alternatively, use
```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/joachimbrand/Rimu.jl", rev="master"))
```
### Usage

The package is now installed and can be imported with
```julia-repl
julia> using Rimu
```
Rimu offers a number of tools for representing Hamiltonians (see
[`Hamiltonians`](@ref)) and state vectors / wave functions (see [`DictVectors`](@ref))
as well as algorithms to find the ground state, e.g. [`lomc!`](@ref).
