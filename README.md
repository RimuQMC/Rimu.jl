*Random Integrators for many-body quantum systems*

The grand aim is to develop a toolbox for many-body quantum systems that can be
represented by a Hamiltonian in second quantisation language. Currently
there
are tools to find the ground state with a Lanczos algorithm
(using [`KrylovKit.jl`](https://github.com/Jutho/KrylovKit.jl) for small Hilbert spaces), or with projector
quantum Monte Carlo in the flavour of FCIQMC (see [References](@ref)).
Later, we may add tools to solve the
time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation and Master equations for open system
time evolution.

### Installing Rimu

`Rimu` can be installed with the package manager directly from the github
repository. Hit the `]` key at the Julia REPL to get into `Pkg` mode and
type
```julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/joachimbrand/Rimu.jl
```
Alternatively, use
```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/joachimbrand/Rimu.jl"))
```
in order to install `Rimu` from a script.

### Usage

The package is now installed and can be imported with
```julia-repl
julia> using Rimu
```
`Rimu` offers a number of tools for representing Hamiltonians and
state vectors / wave functions
as well as algorithms for finding the ground state.
