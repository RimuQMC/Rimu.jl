    SpawningStrategy

A `SpawningStrategy` is used to control how spawns (multiplies with off-diagonal part of the
column vector) are performed and can be passed to some of the [`StochasticStyle`](@ref)s as
keyword arguments.

The following concrete implementations are provided:

* [`Exact`](@ref): Perform exact spawns. Used by [`IsDeterministic`](@ref).

* [`WithReplacement`](@ref): The default stochastic spawning strategy. Spawns are chosen
  with replacement.

* [`DynamicSemistochastic`](@ref): Behave like [`Exact`](@ref) when the number of spawns
  performed is high, and like a different substrategy otherwise. Used by
  [`IsDynamicSemistochastic`](@ref).

* [`SingleSpawn`](@ref): Perform a single spawn only. Used as a building block for other
  strategies.

* [`WithoutReplacement`](@ref): Similar to [`WithReplacement`](@ref), but ensures each spawn
  is only performed once. Only to be used as a substrategy of
  [`DynamicSemistochastic`](@ref).

* [`Bernoulli`](@ref): Each spawn is attempted with a fixed probability. Only to be used as
  a substrategy of [`DynamicSemistochastic`](@ref).

[`SpawningStrategy`](@ref) that behaves like `strat` when the number of walkers is low, but

described below.

## Parameters

* `strat = WithReplacement()`: a [`SpawningStrategy`](@ref) to use when the multiplication
  is not performed exactly. If the `strat` has a `threshold` different from zero, all spawns
  will be projected to that threshold.

* `rel_threshold = 1.0`: When deciding on whether to perform an exact spawn, this value is
  multiplied to the number of walkers. Should be set to 1 or more for best performance. This
  threshold is affected by the `boost` argument to [`spawn!`](@ref).

* `abs_threshold = Inf`: When deciding on whether to perform an exact spawn,
  `min(abs_threshold, num_offdiagonals)` is used. This threshold is not affected by
  the `boost` argument to [`spawn!`](@ref).

See e.g. [`WithoutReplacement`](@ref) for a description of the `strat.threshold` parameter.
