"""
    ReplicaStrategy{N}

Supertype for strategies that can be passed to [`lomc!`](@ref) and control how many
replicas are used, and what information is computed and returned. The number of replicas
is `N`.

## Concrete implementations

* [`NoStats`](@ref): run (possibly one) replica(s), but don't report any additional info.
* [`AllOverlaps`](@ref): report overlaps between all pairs of replica vectors.

## Interface

A subtype of `ReplicaStrategy{N}` must implement the following
function:

* [`Rimu.replica_stats`](@ref) - return a
  tuple of `String`s or `Symbols` of names for replica statistics and a tuple of the values.
  These will be reported to the `DataFrame` returned by [`lomc!`](@ref).
"""
abstract type ReplicaStrategy{N} end

"""
    replica_stats(RS::ReplicaStrategy{N}, replicas::NTuple{N,ReplicaState}) -> (names, values)

Return the names and values of statistics related to `N` replicas consistent with the
[`ReplicaStrategy`](@ref) `RS`. `names`
should be a tuple of `Symbol`s or `String`s and `values` should be a tuple of the same
length. This fuction will be called once per time step from [`lomc!`](@ref).

Part of the [`ReplicaStrategy`](@ref) interface. See also [`ReplicaState`](@ref).
"""

collected.

    AllOverlaps(n=2, operator=nothing) <: ReplicaStrategy{n}

Run `n` replicas and report overlaps between all pairs of replica vectors. If operator is
not `nothing`, the overlap `dot(c1, operator, c2)` is reported as well. If operator is a tuple
of operators, the overlaps are computed for all operators.

Column names in the report are of the form c{i}_dot_c{j} for vector-vector overlaps, and
c{i}_Op{k}_c{j} for operator overlaps.

See [`lomc!`](@ref), [`ReplicaStrategy`](@ref) and [`AbstractHamiltonian`](@ref) (for an
interface for implementing operators).
