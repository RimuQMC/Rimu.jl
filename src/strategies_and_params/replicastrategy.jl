    ReplicaStrategy{N}

Supertype for strategies that can be passed to [`ProjectorMonteCarloProblem`](@ref) and
control how many replicas are used, and what information is computed and returned. The
number of replicas is `N`.

## Concrete implementations

* [`NoStats`](@ref): run (possibly one) replica(s), but don't report any additional info.
* [`AllOverlaps`](@ref): report overlaps between all pairs of replica vectors.

## Interface

A subtype of `ReplicaStrategy{N}` must implement the following
function:

* [`Rimu.replica_stats`](@ref) - return a
  tuple of `String`s or `Symbols` of names for replica statistics and a tuple of the values.
  These will be reported to the `DataFrame` returned by [`ProjectorMonteCarloProblem`](@ref).
"""
abstract type ReplicaStrategy{N} end

"""
    num_replicas(state_or_strategy)

Return the number of replicas used in the simulation.
"""
num_replicas(::ReplicaStrategy{N}) where {N} = N

"""
    replica_stats(RS::ReplicaStrategy{N}, spectral_states::NTuple{N,SingleState}) -> (names, values)

Return the names and values of statistics related to `N` replica states consistent with the
[`ReplicaStrategy`](@ref) `RS`. `names`
should be a tuple of `Symbol`s or `String`s and `values` should be a tuple of the same
length. This function will be called every [`reporting_interval`](@ref) steps from
[`ProjectorMonteCarloProblem`](@ref), or once per time step if `reporting_interval` is not
defined.

"""
    AllOverlaps(n_replicas=2; operator=nothing, transform=nothing, vecnorm=true, mixed_spectral_overlaps=false)
        <: ReplicaStrategy{n_replicas}

Run `n_replicas` replicas and report overlaps between all pairs of replica vectors. If
`operator` is not `nothing`, the overlap `dot(r1, operator, r2)` is reported as well. If
`operator` is a tuple of operators, the overlaps are computed for all operators.

Column names in the report are of the form `r{i}s{k}_dot_r{j}s{k}` for vector-vector
overlaps, and `r{i}s{k}_Op{m}_r{j}s{k}` for operator overlaps, where `i` and `j` label the
replicas, `k` labels the spectral state, and `m` labels the operators.

The `r{i}s{k}_dot_r{j}s{k}` overlap can be omitted with the flag `vecnorm=false`.

By default, overlaps of different spectral states are omitted. To include overlaps of
different spectral states `r{i}s{k}_dot_r{j}s{l}` and `r{i}s{k}_Op{m}_r{j}s{l}`, use the
flag `mixed_spectral_overlaps=true`. 

See [`ProjectorMonteCarloProblem`](@ref), [`ReplicaStrategy`](@ref) and
[`AbstractOperator`](@ref Interfaces.AbstractOperator) (for an interface for implementing
operators).

# Transformed Hamiltonians

If a transformed Hamiltonian `G` has been passed to [`ProjectorMonteCarloProblem`](@ref)
then overlaps can be calculated by passing the same transformed Hamiltonian to `AllOverlaps`
by setting `transform=G`. A warning is given if these two Hamiltonians do not match.

Implemented transformations are:

 * [`GutzwillerSampling`](@ref)
 * [`GuidingVectorSampling`](@ref)

In the case of a transformed Hamiltonian the overlaps are defined as follows. For a
similarity transformation `G` of the Hamiltonian (see e.g. [`GutzwillerSampling`](@ref).)
```math
    \\hat{G} = f \\hat{H} f^{-1}.
```
The expectation value of an operator ``\\hat{A}`` is
```math
    \\langle \\hat{A} \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | \\hat{A} | \\psi \\rangle
        = \\frac{\\langle \\phi | f^{-1} \\hat{A} f^{-1} | \\phi \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi | f^{-2} | \\phi \\rangle}
```
where
```math
    | \\phi \\rangle = f | \\psi \\rangle
```
is the (right) eigenvector of ``\\hat{G}`` and ``| \\psi \\rangle`` is an eigenvector of
``\\hat{H}``.

For an ``m``-tuple of input operators ``(\\hat{A}_1, ..., \\hat{A}_m)``, overlaps of
``\\langle \\phi | f^{-1} \\hat{A} f^{-1} | \\phi \\rangle`` are reported as
`r{i}s{k}_Op{m}_r{j}s{k}`. The correct vector-vector overlap ``\\langle \\phi | f^{-2} | \\phi
\\rangle`` is reported *last* as `r{i}s{k}_Op{m+1}_r{j}s{k}`. This is in addition to the *bare*
vector-vector overlap ``\\langle \\phi | \\phi \\rangle`` that is reported as 
`r{i}s{k}_dot_r{j}s{k}`.
