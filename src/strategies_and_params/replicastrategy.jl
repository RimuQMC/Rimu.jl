    ReplicaStrategy{N}

An abstract type that controles how [`lomc!`](@ref) uses replicas. A subtype of
`ReplicaStrategy{N}` operates on `N` replicas and must implement the following function:

* [`replica_stats(::ReplicaStrategy{N}, ::NTuple{N,ReplicaState})`](@ref) - return a tuple
  of `String`s or `Symbols` of replica statistic names and a tuple of the values.  These
  will be reported to the `DataFrame` returned by [`lomc!`](@ref)

Concrete implementations:

* [`NoStats`](@ref): run (possibly one) replica(s), but don't report any additional info.
* [`AllOverlaps`](@ref): report overlaps between all pairs of replica vectors.

Return the names and values of statistics reported by `ReplicaStrategy`. `names` should be

Run `n` replicas and report overlaps between all pairs of replica vectors. If operator is
not `nothing`, the overlap `dot(c1, operator, c2)` is reported as well. If operator is a tuple
of operators, the overlaps are computed for all operators.

Column names in the report are of the form c{i}_dot_c{j} for vector-vector overlaps, and
c{i}_Op{k}_c{j} for operator overlaps.

See [`ReplicaStrategy`](@ref) and [`AbstractHamiltonian`](@ref) (for an interface for
implementing operators).
