    StochasticStyle(v)
`StochasticStyle` specifies the native style of the generalised vector `v` that determines
how simulations are to proceed. This can be fully stochastic (with `IsStochasticInteger`),
fully deterministic (with `IsDeterministic`), or stochastic with floating point walker
numbers and threshold (with [`IsStochasticWithThreshold`](@ref)).

When defining a new `StochasticStyle`, subtype it as `MyStyle<:StochasticStyle{T}` where `T`
is the concrete value type the style is designed to work with.

For it to work with FCIQMC, a `StochasticStyle` must define the following:

* [`fciqmc_col!(::StochasticStyle, w, H, address, value, shift, dÏ„)`](@ref)
* [`step_stats(::StochasticStyle)`](@ref)

Optionally, it can also define [`update_dvec!`](@ref), which can be used to perform arbitrary
transformations on the `dvec` after the spawning step is complete.

    IsDynamicSemistochastic(rel_threshold=1, abs_threshold=Inf, proj_threshold=1) <: StochasticStyle

Similar to [`IsStochasticWithThreshold`](@ref), but does exact spawning when the number of
walkers in a configuration is high.

Unlike with [`IsStochasticWithThreshold`](@ref), when `late_projection` is set to `true`,
walker annihilation is done before the stochastic projection.

## Parameters:

* `late_projection = true`: If set to true, threshold projection is done after all spawns are
  collected, otherwise, values are projected as they are being spawned.

* `rel_threshold = 1.0`: If the walker number on a configuration times this threshold
  is greater than the number of offdiagonals, spawning is done deterministically. Should be
  set to 1 or more for best performance.

* `abs_threshold = Inf`: If the walker number on a configuration is greater than this value,
  spawning is done deterministically. Can be set to e.g
  `abs_threshold = 0.1 * target_walkers`.

* `proj_threshold = 1.0`: Values below this number are stochastically projected to this
  value or zero. See also [`IsStochasticWithThreshold`](@ref).
